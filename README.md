# ludexium
Ludexium, a social cataloging app for video games.

This is my submission for the Choose Your Own Adventure Challenge for the DALI Lab.

I implemented a database for user information.
I query the IGDB (Internet Games Database) for video game info.
Python's ```igdb-api-v4``` [[(Github here)](https://github.com/twitchtv/igdb-api-python)]

[ChartJS plugin for colors](https://github.com/kurkle/chartjs-plugin-autocolors)

My Learning Journey:
Mainly learned Flask from [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial.](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
I also utilized parts of the templates in that tutorial, including the user login system, but everything else is new functionality.

I also implemented JavaScript for frontend interactivity which I didn't have much experience with before.

Since I was pretty familiar with Python, I decided to write the backend in it.
So I chose the Flask framework, which I had never worked with before this.
Actually, this is my first time doing backend for any kind of real project.

An SQLite database. This is also my first experience working with SQL tables and any database.
I store information about users, posts, games.
