# ludexium
Ludexium, a social cataloging app for video games.

This is my submission for the Choose Your Own Adventure Challenge for the DALI Lab.

I implemented a database for user information.
I query the IGDB (Internet Games Database) for video game info.
Python's igdb-api-v4


Inspirations:
Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial.

My Learning Journey:
I also implemented JavaScript for frontend interactivity which I didn't have much experience with before.

Since I was pretty familiar with Python, I decided to write the backend in it.
So I chose the Flask framework, which I had never worked with before this.
Actually, this is my first time doing backend for any kind of real project.

An SQLite database.
I store information about users, posts, games.
