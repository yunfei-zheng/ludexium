TODO:
Have some sort of landing page for first visit to the website, like check out all the cool features

I need to actually make the website look good.
dark mode switching, hover effects, color scheme, table borders, etc. still needed

Add an automatic post every time a game is added to played list?

Need to make some sort of timeline.

Test email config..

Think more about the layout...
So an option to log hours...
Then like a graph.
