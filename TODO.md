TODO:
I need to actually make the website look good.

Add an automatic post every time a game is added to played list?

Need to make some sort of timeline.

Test email config..

Need to filter out all the random non video game add on stuff...

Think more about the layout...
So an option to log hours...
Then like a graph.

Look into ChartJS
game.js has an issue
